# Arctic Mapping Tools
This is a Northern-hemisphere edition of [Antarctic Mapping Tools for MATLAB](https://github.com/chadagreene/Antarctic-Mapping-Tools). 

# Documentation 
Most of the functions in this GitHub repo directly mimic functions in the [Antarctic version](https://github.com/chadagreene/Antarctic-Mapping-Tools), and that's where you'll find the best documentation for the Arctic tools. 

Most of the functions in this toolbox end with the letter `n` to indicate the _northern_ hemisphere version of the Antarctic tools. For example, The Arctic function `plotpsn` is equivalent to the Antarctic `plotps` function. 
 
#  Plugins
Here are some Greenland datasets that are designed to work with Arctic Mapping Tools: 

* [BedMachine](https://github.com/chadagreene/BedMachine) Greenland and Antarctic ice thickness, bed elevation, surface elevation, and masks. 
* [ITS\_LIVE](https://github.com/chadagreene/ITS_LIVE) global ice velocity mosaics. 
* Check the [File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange?q=greenland) for potentially more datasets, or email me if you something specific in mind that you'd like to see.
